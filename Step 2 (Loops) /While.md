The `while` loop in programming is a control flow statement that allows a block of code to be repeatedly executed as long as a specified condition is true.
Here is the basic structure of a `while` loop:

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

The loop begins by evaluating the specified condition. If the condition is true, the block of code inside the `while` loop is executed.
After the code block is executed, the condition is evaluated again. If the condition is still true, the code block is executed again. 
This process continues until the condition becomes false, at which point the loop terminates, and the program proceeds to the next statement after the `while` loop.

Here's a simple example of a `while` loop in Java:

```java
public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 1;

        while (count <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
            count++; // Incrementing the count to eventually exit the loop
        }

        System.out.println("Loop has ended.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the `count` variable is less than or equal to 5.
The loop prints the current value of `count` and increments it in each iteration.
The output demonstrates the iterative nature of the `while` loop until the condition becomes false.
